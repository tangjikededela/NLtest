The model you choose is '{{ model }}' which means
which means each time when {{Xcol}} increase by 1,
the {{ycol}} will always change by {{slope}}.

After some mathematical calculation and verification,
{% if R < 0.8 %}
they show this is not a highly reliable model.
Maybe you could try to change another model.
{% elif R < 0.9 and R > 0.8%}
they show this is a highly reliable model.
{% else %}
they show this is a very highly reliable model.
{% endif %}
{% if p2.all() == nan %}
It also shows that the relationship between {{ycol}} and {{Xcol}} is a very common phenomenon,
not because this group of data is special.
{% elif pd1 ==1 %}
It also shows the relationship between {{ycol}} and {{Xcol}} is not a common phenomenon at all.
{% elif pd2 ==1 %}
It also shows that the relationship between {{ycol}} and {{Xcol}} may be not a common phenomenon.
{% elif pd3 ==1 %}
It also shows the relationship between {{ycol}} and some of {{Xcol}} is not a very common phenomenon.
{% elif pd4 ==1 %}
It also shows that the relationship between {{ycol}} and some of {{Xcol}} may be not a common phenomenon.
{% else %}
It also shows that the relationship between {{ycol}} and {{Xcol}} is a very common phenomenon,
not because this group of data is special.
