The model you choose is '{{ model }}' which belong to 'scikit-learn' package,
If you try to make a prediction model that predicts how {{ycol}} will change when {{Xcol}} increase
this will be a good choice,
because 'scikit-learn' is designed for machine-learning which is good at predicting,
otherwise, if you try to make an explain model, 'statsmodels' could be a good choice,
while 'statsmodels' is best employed for explanatory models.
The intercept is {{inter}}, which means when {{Xcol}} is 0,
the {{ycol}} will be {{inter}}, but consider about {{Xcol}} may not be 0,
it may have no practical significance.
The slope is {{slope}}, which means each time when {{Xcol}} increase 1,
the {{ycol}} will change {{slope}}.

The std error is {{sd}},
and the p - value is
{{p}}.
And the coefficient of determination is {{ R }},
{% if R < 0.8 %}
Since the coefficient of determination is less than 0.9,
which means this is not a highly reliable model.
And that might be caused by under fitted,
maybe you could try to change another model, or change the parameters.
{% elif R < 0.9 and R > 0.8%}
Since the coefficient of determination is between 0.8 and 0.9,
which means this is a highly reliable model.
{% else %}
The coefficient of determination is between 0.9 and 1,
this model fits well and means this is a very highly reliable model.
{% endif %}
{% if p2.all() == nan %}
The p - value is very small which almost is 0, so it is statistically significant,
which means the relationship between {{ycol}} and {{Xcol}} is a very common phenomenon,
not because this group of data is special.
{% elif pd1 ==1 %}
Since all of the p - value is bigger than 0.07,
this is not statistically significant,
which means the relationship between {{ycol}} and {{Xcol}} is not a very common phenomenon.
{% elif pd2 ==1 %}
Since all of the p - value is bigger than usual significance level of 0.05,
this might is not statistically significant,
which means the relationship between {{ycol}} and {{Xcol}} is might not a very common phenomenon.
{% elif pd3 ==1 %}
Since some of the p - value is bigger than 0.07,
this is not statistically significant,
which means the relationship between {{ycol}} and some of {{Xcol}} is not a very common phenomenon.
{% elif pd4 ==1 %}
Since some of the p - value is bigger than usual significance level of 0.05,
this might is not statistically significant,
which means the relationship between {{ycol}} and some of {{Xcol}} is might not a very common phenomenon.
{% else %}
The p - value is less than 0.05 which is very small, so it is statistically significant,
which means the relationship between {{ycol}} and {{Xcol}} is a very common phenomenon,
not because this group of data is special.
