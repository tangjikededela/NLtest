The model's details you choose are:
'{{ model }}',
the slope is {{slope}},
which means when independent variable increase 1,
the controlled variable will change {{slope}}.
The p values is {{p_value}},
the Standard error is {{std_err}}.
And the coefficient of determination is {{ R }},
the Spearman correlation coefficient is {{rho}},
the Kendall's tau is {{tau}}.
{% if R < 0.9 %}
Since the coefficient of determination is less than 0.9,
which means this is not a highly reliable model.
And that might caused by underfitted,
maybe you could try to change another model, or change the parameters.
{% else %}
The coefficient of determination is between 0.9 and 1,
this model fits well and means this is a highly reliable model.
{% endif %}
{% if tau > 0.5 and tau < 1.0 %}
Since the Kendall's tau is between 0.5 and 1,
which means this is the two variables have strong agreement.
{% elif tau < -0.5 and tau > -1.0 %}
The Kendall's tau is between -0.5 and -1,
which means this is the two variables have strong disagreement.
{% else %}
The Kendall's tau is between -0.5 and 0.5.
That means the two variables do not have either strong agreement or strong disagreement.
{% endif %}
{% if rho < 0.5 and rho >-0.5%}
Since the Spearman correlation coefficient is between than -0.5 and 0.5,
which means the correlation is not so high.
{% elif rho > 0.5 %}
Since the Spearman correlations is close to +1 which mean there is an exact monotonic relationship.
{% else %}
Since the Spearman correlations is close to -1 which mean there is an exact monotonic relationship.
