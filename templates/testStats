{% macro CI(R) %}{{R}} CI{% endmacro -%}


The model you choose is '{{ model }}',
and the coefficient of determination is {{ R }},
the adjusted coefficient of determination is {{R2}},
the regression coefficients is {{RC}},
and the predicted response is
{{y_pre}}
{% if R < 0.9 %}
Since the coefficient of determination is less than 0.9,
which means this is not a highly reliable model.
And that might caused by underfitted,
maybe you could try to change another model, or change the parameters.
{% else %}
The coefficient of determination is between 0.9 and 1,
this model fits well and means this is a highly reliable model.
