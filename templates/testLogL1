What this model doing is try to make a classification  model that determine if {{ycol}}
by changing {{Xcol}},
After some mathematical calculation and verification,
it finds {{CF}}
{% if Accuracy < 0.8 %}
However, it shows this is not a highly reliable model.
Maybe you could try to change another model.
{% elif Accuracy < 0.9 and Accuracy > 0.8%}
Also, it shows this is a highly reliable model.
{% else %}
Also, it shows this is a very highly reliable model.
{% endif %}
The precision is {{Precision}},
which means when the model predicted {{ycol}} ,
that patients have {{Precision}} of the time.
