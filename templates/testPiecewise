You made a piecewise model for the data,
which means there are some break points in the data,
and you can use different models to fit them.

The first model you choose is {{model1}},
In this part, the {{ycol}} change {{change1}} during {{Xcol}} increase.
{% if change1 < CD and change1 > -CD %}
Which means the {{ycol}} does not change much, and it is stable in this part.
{% elif change1 < 0 %}
Which means the {{ycol}} decrease when {{Xcol}} increase.
{% elif change1 > 0 %}
Which means the {{ycol}} increase when {{Xcol}} increase.
{% endif %}

The sceond model you choose is {{model2}},
In this part, the {{ycol}} change {{change2}} during {{Xcol}} increase.
{% if change2 < CD and change2 > -CD %}
Which means the {{ycol}} does not change much, and it is stable in this part.
{% elif change2 < 0 %}
Which means the {{ycol}} decrease when {{Xcol}} increase.
{% elif change2 > 0 %}
Which means the {{ycol}} increase when {{Xcol}} increase.
{% endif %}

The sceond model you choose is {{model3}},
In this part, the {{ycol}} change {{change3}} during {{Xcol}} increase.
{% if change3 < CD and change3 > -CD %}
Which means the {{ycol}} does not change much, and it is stable in this part.
{% elif change3 < 0 %}
Which means the {{ycol}} decrease when {{Xcol}} increase.
{% elif change3 > 0 %}
Which means the {{ycol}} increase when {{Xcol}} increase.
{% endif %}

In summary, the realationship between {{ycol}} and {{Xcol}} is,
{% if change1 < CD and change1 > -CD %}
the {{ycol}} does not change much in the beginning.
{% elif change1 < 0 %}
the {{ycol}} decrease when {{Xcol}} increase in the beginning.
{% elif change1 > 0 %}
the {{ycol}} increase when {{Xcol}} increase in the beginning.
{% endif %}
{% if change2 < CD and change2 > -CD %}
and then the {{ycol}} keeps stable for a while.
{% elif change2 < 0 %}
and then the {{ycol}} decrease when {{Xcol}} increase.
{% elif change2 > 0 %}
and then the {{ycol}} increase when {{Xcol}} increase.
{% endif %}
{% if change3 < CD and change3 > -CD %}
In the end, the {{ycol}} become stable, and does not change much.
{% elif change3 < 0 %}
In the end, the {{ycol}} decrease as {{Xcol}} increase.
{% elif change3 > 0 %}
In the end, the {{ycol}} increase as {{Xcol}} increase.
{% endif %}
