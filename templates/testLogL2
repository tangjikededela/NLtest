The model you choose is '{{ model }}',
If you try to make a classification  model that determine if {{ycol}}
by changing {{Xcol}},
this will be a good choice.
The coefficient(s) is {{cof}},
which means {{CF}}
There is a heatmap shows,
You can check if the classification is accurate or not.
Well, you got a classification rate of {{Accuracy}}.
{% if Accuracy < 0.8 %}
it shows this is not a highly reliable model.
Maybe you could try to change another model.
{% elif Accuracy < 0.9 and Accuracy > 0.8%}
it shows this is a highly reliable model.
{% else %}
it shows this is a very highly reliable model.
{% endif %}
The precision is {{Precision}},
which means when your Logistic Regression model predicted {{ycol}} ,
that patients have {{Precision}} of the time.
Another it finds
{% if AUC < 0.7 %}
this is not a highly reliable classifier.
{% elif AUC < 0.8 and AUC > 0.7%}
this may is a useable classifier.
{% elif AUC < 0.9 and AUC > 0.8%}
this is a highly reliable classifier.
{% else %}
this is a almost perfect classifier.
{% endif %}
