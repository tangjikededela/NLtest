{% macro CI(R) %}{{R}} CI{% endmacro -%}


The model you choose is '{{ model }}',
the degree you choose is {{deg}}.
and the coefficient of determination is {{ R }},

{% if R < 0.9 %}
Since the coefficient of determination is less than 0.9,
which means this is not a highly reliable model.
And that might caused by underfitted,
maybe you could try to change another model, or change the parameters, or the degree.
{% else %}
The coefficient of determination is between 0.9 and 1,
this model fits well and means this is a highly reliable model.
However, since you choose '{{ model }}',
a very big degree number also can cause a high coefficient of determination
with fitting is only consistent with the part of known data,
but the prediction is not accurate.
