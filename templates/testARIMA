{% macro CI(R) %}{{R}} CI{% endmacro -%}


The model you choose is '{{ model }}',
and the coefficient of determination is {{ R }},
if the data is gold prices, the prices predictions will be
{{y_pre}}.
{% if R < 90 and R > 80 %}
Since the coefficient of determination is between 0.8 and 0.9,
which means this is a reliable model,
but maybe you could try to change the parameters to improve it.
{% elif R < 80 and R > 70  %}
Since the coefficient of determination is between 0.7 and 0.8,
which means this is not a very highly reliable model,
however since this is ARIMA model which is more complex, so it still is useable.
maybe you could try to change another model, or change the parameters.
{% elif R < 70  %}
Since the coefficient of determination is lower than 0.7,
which means this is not a highly reliable model,
maybe you could try to change another model, or change the parameters.
{% else %}
The coefficient of determination is between 0.9 and 1,
this model fits well and means this is a highly reliable model.
{% endif %}
